#### Exercise 4

Change the text in the element with the id spanText to whatever you want

#### Exercise 5

#### Exercise 8

Write a function that will take a string parameter. Then save this string as an object:

}

Pass this object to the second function in which you read a string from the object and assign it to a variable. Then set this class to the element with the id myDiv.

#### Exercise 9

Write a function that will add the appropriate class to the element with id "numbers" depending on the passed parameter. The parameter should be a random number between 0-10.
If the number is even set the class' even 'to odd' odd;

#### Exercise 10
