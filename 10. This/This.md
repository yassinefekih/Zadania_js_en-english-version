#### Excercise 1

Create 2 person and person2 objects. Let them have the following properties:

* First name
* Name
* Age
* Country
* City

Create methods:

1. Which will list all information about this person
2. Which adds 1 year to the age each time it is called

Then write several calls to method number 2 in different contexts to check how it works. 

#### Excercise 2

Extend the person and person2 objects from the previous task with a new array-type field that will hold the person's favorite dishes. Then write a method which will print the contents of this field in the console and a method which will add additional elements to this field. All these things are to be outside the original body of the object

#### Excercise 3

Write a calculator that will add, subtract, multiply and divide. Methods needed:

1. A method that saves the numbers a and b in the context of an object
2. A method of adding up previously saved numbers
3. A method that subtracts previously saved numbers
4. A method of multiplying previously saved numbers
5. The method of dividing previously written numbers. If the number b = 0 then print an appropriate error message in the console.

#### Excercise 4

Create a simple simulator of climbing and descending a ladder. You will need three methods. Think about what?
